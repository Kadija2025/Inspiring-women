            <p>Hedy Lamarr was an Austrian-American actress and inventor who pioneered the technology that would one day
                form the basis for today’s WiFi, GPS, and Bluetooth communication systems. As a natural beauty seen
                widely on the big screen in films like Samson and Delilah and White Cargo, society has long ignored her
                inventive genius.</p>

            <p>Bessie Coleman soared across the sky as the first African American, and the first Native American, woman

                “The Only Race Aviatrix in the World.” Her goal was to encourage women and African Americans to reach
                their dreams. Unfortunately, her career ended with a tragic plane crash, but her life continues to
                inspire people around the world.</p>

            <p>Being handpicked to be one of three black students to integrate West Virginia’s graduate schools is
                something that many people would consider one of their life’s most notable moments, but it’s just one of
                several breakthroughs that have marked Katherine Johnson’s long and remarkable life. Born in White
                Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, in 1918, her intense curiosity and brilliance with numbers vaulted her
                ahead several grades in school. By 13, she was attending the high school on the campus of historically
                black West Virginia State College. At 18, she enrolled in the college itself, where she made quick work
                of the school’s math curriculum and found a mentor in math professor W. W. Schieffelin Claytor, the
                third African American to earn a PhD in mathematics. She graduated with highest honors in 1937 and took
                a job teaching at a black public school in Virginia. </p>
